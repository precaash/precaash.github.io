I work at the intersection of machine learning and materials science, focusing on the design, modeling, and interpretation of complex materials across scales. My research develops data-driven methods that respect physical laws and remain interpretable, even when data is scarce. I have worked on inverse design of mechanical metamaterials, constitutive modeling from indirect experimental measurements, and generative models for molecules and polymers under physical and chemical constraints.

My current interests center on large-scale generative and representational learning for structured material systems, including graph-based architectures. I am particularly interested in building models that can transfer knowledge across material classes and length scales, and in understanding what such models learn about structure–property relationships when trained on large, heterogeneous datasets.
