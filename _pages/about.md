I work at the intersection of machine learning and materials science, with a focus on designing, modeling, and understanding complex materials across scales. My research develops data-driven methods that respect physical laws and remain interpretable, even when data are scarce or experimentally incomplete. I have worked on inverse design of mechanical metamaterials, constitutive modeling from indirect experimental measurements, and generative models for molecules and polymers that account for chemical and physical constraints. Across these projects, my goal has been to use machine learning not as a black box, but as a tool for uncovering structure–property relationships and enabling reliable material design.
